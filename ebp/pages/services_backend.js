/**
 * EBP backend client — the ONE place that knows where the backend lives.
 *
 * Every call to `ebp-backend` (prioritization, the per-list trend, and
 * cross-project duplication) goes through this file. That is a deliberate rule from the
 * integration plan §7: the existing dashboard hard-codes the GoaT host in five
 * separate pages, and moving it has cost real time every time. One constant,
 * one place.
 *
 * Loaded as a plain <script> like services.js — no modules, no build step.
 *
 *   <script src="./services_backend.js"></script>
 *   const who = await EBPBackend.resolveList(token);
 *
 * ACCESS (plan §12.6, option C). There are no PI accounts in v1. A per-list
 * capability token — handed to the project by the secretariat — authorizes the
 * reads below, and a bad or missing token comes back as 404 with the same body
 * as an unknown list. So `err.notFound` means "this link opens nothing" and
 * MUST NOT be reported as "you are not allowed": the API deliberately refuses
 * to tell us which it was, because saying so would let anyone enumerate other
 * projects' target lists.
