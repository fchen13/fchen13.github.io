# Traffic Data Collection - Issue Resolved ✅

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** FIXED AND OPERATIONAL

---

## 🎯 Issue Summary

Traffic data collection workflow was running successfully every week since September 2025, but **no data was being saved** to the repository.

---

## 🔍 Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Workflow Push Configuration**
- **Problem:** Workflow used generic `${{ github.ref }}` instead of explicit branch name
- **Fix:** Changed to explicit `git push origin ebp-main` in the workflow
  - Note: Within GitHub Actions, `origin` refers to the repository where the workflow runs (EarthBiogenome/dashboard)

### 2. **Gitignore Blocking Files** ⚠️ CRITICAL
- **Problem:** `.gitignore` was blocking ALL traffic data files from being committed:
  ```
  traffic-data/traffic-*.json
  traffic-data/weekly_summary.csv
  traffic-data/*.png
  ```
- **Fix:** Changed blocking rules to allow rules using `!` prefix
- **Result:** Files can now be tracked and committed

### 3. **Date Format Inconsistency**
- **Problem:** Old data used `M/D/Y` format, new data uses `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- **Fix:** Updated `analyze_traffic_data.py` to handle mixed date formats with `format='mixed'`

## ✅ What Was Fixed

| File | Change | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/traffic-collector.yml` | Explicit checkout and push to `ebp-main` branch | Ensure data is committed to correct branch (workflow uses `git push origin ebp-main` where `origin` = the repo running the action) |
| `.gitignore` | Allow traffic data files to be tracked | Remove blocking that prevented commits |
| `traffic-data/analyze_traffic_data.py` | Handle mixed date formats | Parse both old and new date formats |
| `traffic-data/verify_data.py` | New verification script | Simple data check without emoji issues |

## 📊 Data Status

### Recovered Data
✅ **Week 2025-W42** (October 20, 2025) - Successfully collected on Oct 31, 2025
- Views: 16 (3 unique)
- Clones: 15 (10 unique)

### Data Gap (Unrecoverable)
⚠️ **Weeks W36-W41** (September - early October 2025) - Permanently lost
- Reason: GitHub API only retains 14 days of traffic data
- These weeks cannot be recovered

### Historical Data (Intact)
✅ **Weeks W29-W35** (July 15 - August 25, 2025) - Available

---

## 🚀 System Status: OPERATIONAL

The automated traffic data collection is now working correctly:

- ✅ Workflow runs every Monday at 2:00 AM UTC
- ✅ Collects data for the previous completed week
- ✅ Creates JSON file with detailed daily breakdowns
- ✅ Updates `weekly_summary.csv` with weekly totals
- ✅ Commits and pushes data to `ebp-main` branch
- ✅ No manual intervention required

---

## 📖 How to Use

### View Latest Data
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\fchen13\ASU Dropbox\Fang Chen\Work Documents\EBP\Dashboard reports"
git pull
```

### Run Analysis
```powershell
cd traffic-data
python analyze_traffic_data.py
```

This will:
- Display data table with all weeks
- Generate `traffic_trends_analysis.png` with visualizations
- Show summary statistics (totals, averages, peak activity)

### Quick Data Check
```powershell
cd traffic-data
python verify_data.py
```

Simple verification without visualizations.

### View Raw Data
- **CSV:** Open `weekly_summary.csv` in Excel
- **JSON:** Individual `traffic-YYYY-WXX.json` files contain daily breakdowns

## 🔮 Next Collection

**Next scheduled run:** Monday, November 3, 2025 at 2:00 AM UTC  
**Will collect:** Week 2025-W43 (October 27 - November 2, 2025)

---

## 📋 Weekly Monitoring (Optional)

Every Monday after 2:30 AM UTC, you can:
1. Check GitHub Actions for green checkmark ✅
2. Pull latest data: `git pull`
3. Verify last entry: `Get-Content traffic-data/weekly_summary.csv | Select-Object -Last 1`

Or just let it run automatically and pull data whenever you need it!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If Data Stops Updating Again

1. **Check Workflow Runs:** https://github.com/EarthBiogenome/dashboard/actions
2. **Look for errors** in the workflow logs
3. **Check Summary** section of workflow run for push status

### Common Issues

**No changes committed:**
- Check if files are accidentally gitignored again
- Verify workflow is running on `ebp-main` branch

**API Rate Limits:**
- Wait 1 hour and manually trigger workflow again

**Token Issues:**
- Verify `TRAFFIC_TOKEN` secret exists and hasn't expired
- Token needs `repo` scope with write permissions

## 📚 Documentation Files

Created during resolution:
- `RECOVERY_PLAN.md` - Detailed recovery procedures
- `MANUAL_TRIGGER_GUIDE.txt` - Step-by-step workflow trigger instructions
- `check_workflow_status.md` - Troubleshooting guide
- `verify_data.py` - Simple data verification script (PowerShell-friendly)

## ✨ Success Metrics

- ✅ Issue diagnosed and root cause identified
- ✅ All blocking issues resolved
- ✅ First successful data collection completed (W42)
- ✅ Analysis scripts updated and tested
- ✅ Documentation created for future reference
- ✅ System monitoring procedures established

---

**Status:** System is now fully operational and will continue collecting data automatically every week. No further action required unless monitoring indicates an issue.
